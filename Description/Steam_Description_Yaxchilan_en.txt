[h1]Known Issues & How To Contribute?[/h1]
[list][*]Worked tiles in the outer rings currently lack animations, such as spinning windmills. If you have experience with [b]improvement 3D modding[/b] and would like to contribute, please get in touch with us.
[*]Currently game assets are reused for the district and building. Unique 3D models would significantly enhance the mod.
[*]Tiles in outer rings acquired through purchase, swapping, or culture bombs won’t apply modifiers (such as the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus) until the game is reloaded.
[*]Translating into Russian, Polish, and Korean.[/list]
